# Turku-neural-parser-pipeline
A new take on the trusty old Finnish-dep-parser with pretrained models for more than 50 languages. The current pipeline is fully neural and has a substantially better accuracy in all layers of prediction (segmentation, morphological tagging, syntax, lemmatization).

This is the old version of the parser (prior to August 2021), and it's documentation is available at https://turkunlp.org/Turku-neural-parser-pipeline/old/index.html
